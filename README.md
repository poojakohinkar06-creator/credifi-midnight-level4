# CrediFi — Privacy-Preserving Loan Eligibility & Risk Verification on Midnight

CrediFi is a **Level 4 Midnight Builder** project. It lets a user prove to a
lender that a *verified* financial credential satisfies a lending requirement —
**income ≥ minimumIncome** and **no previous default** — without ever revealing
the exact income or the private financial history.

The eligibility evaluation runs entirely inside a **zero-knowledge circuit**.
Only the *outcome* (which requirements were satisfied and whether the user is
eligible) is written to the ledger. The exact income and the previous-default
flag are **witness-only** and never cross the private/public boundary.

> **Deployment status:** on-chain deployment on Midnight **Preprod** is
> documented but **not yet executed** — it requires a running proof server and a
> funded wallet (see [Deployment](./docs/deploy-onchain.md)). The contract
> address is **never fabricated**; it is a typed placeholder until a genuine
> deployment exists.

## Problem statement

Lending decisions depend on sensitive financial facts — income, credit history,
and whether an applicant has previously defaulted. Sharing this data directly
with a lender is invasive and creates large attack surface: the very facts a
user needs to keep private are the ones a lender asks for.

CrediFi addresses the question: *how can a lender verify loan eligibility and
risk without the applicant having to reveal their exact income or private
financial history?*

Borrowers deserve mainstream financial services — access to credit — without
surrendering their most sensitive data to every lender they apply to.

## Solution

CrediFi lets an applicant prove to a lender that a **verified** financial
credential satisfies a lending requirement using a **zero-knowledge proof** on
the Midnight Network. The evaluation (income ≥ threshold, no prior default) runs
entirely **inside the ZK circuit** on private witnesses. The lender can verify
with confidence that the signed credential came from a trusted issuer and meets
the criteria, while the applicant reveals **only** a yes/no eligibility summary.

- Built in [Compact](https://docs.midnight.network/compact), Midnight's
  privacy-preserving smart-contract language.
- Credentials are signed by a trusted issuer with Schnorr signatures over
  Jubjub and verified in-circuit (tamper-evident + non-replayable).
- Only binary outcome flags are written to the ledger; the exact income and
  default flag never cross the private/public boundary.

---

## Highlights

- **Private-by-design contract** written in [Compact](https://docs.midnight.network/compact),
  verified by 17 contract tests proving both the eligibility matrix **and** that
  witness inputs stay off-ledger.
- **Schnorr attestations over Jubjub** signed by a deterministic mock credential
  issuer and verified **inside the ZK circuit** (`schnorr.compact`).
- **Tamper-evident binding**: each credential is cryptographically bound to the
  holder's derived identity, so signatures cannot be replayed or reused.
- **Admin-guarded governance**: only the contract admin can register/remove
  trusted issuers (enforced in-circuit).
- **Demo web app** that runs the **official compiled contract** in-process to
  produce genuine results — no fabricated outcomes.
- **CI/CD** (.github/workflows) that compiles the contract, regenerates ZK
  bindings, and runs all tests/builds on every push.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 22** and npm
- The **Compact devtools + compiler** (see [Installation](https://docs.midnight.network/getting-started/installation)):
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/latest/download/compact-installer.sh | sh
  compact update 0.31.1   # match the contract language version
  ```
- For **on-chain** deployment only: a running proof server (Docker +
  `midnight_bn254`) and a funded Preprod wallet.

---

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install workspace dependencies
npm install

# 2. Compile the Compact contract (regenerates managed bindings + zkir)
npm run contract:compile

npm run contract:test

# 4. Build both packages
npm run build

# 5. Run the frontend engine tests
npm run frontend:test

# 6. Start the demo web app
npm run frontend:dev
```

## How the privacy works

1. A trusted credential issuer signs the user's financial data
   (`monthlyIncome`, `previousDefault`, `holderHash`) with a Schnorr signature
   over Midnight's native Jubjub curve.
2. The user connects a wallet, supplies their (private) credential, and requests
   verification against a lender-defined requirement.
3. Inside the Midnight ZK circuit, CrediFi checks the issuer is registered and
   the signature is valid, then evaluates **income ≥ minimumIncome** and the
   no-default requirement — all on **private witnesses**.
4. Only the **binary eligibility summary** (boolean flags + the lender's own
   threshold) is disclosed and stored in the ledger, keyed by the holder's
   derived, unlinkable identity hash.

A user's exact income is never serialized into any ledger field, result record,
or proof. This is enforced and proven by the contract privacy tests.

## Documentation

- [Setup guide](./docs/setup.md) — detailed environment setup
- [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) — contract, witnesses, engine design
- [MVP scope](./docs/mvp-scope.md) — the five attestation approaches delivered
- [Deployment (Preprod)](./docs/deploy-onchain.md) — how a real on-chain
  deployment is performed (proof-server prerequisites, wallet, wiring)

---

## Roadmap / deferred

- **Real on-chain deployment** on Preprod (proof server + funded wallet) and set
  `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.
- **Lace wallet** integration for genuine on-chain submissions.
- Issuer runs as a trusted **backend service** (the mock issuer's deterministic
  secret is simulation-only and must never live in client code).

---

## Testing

The core guarantees — correctness **and** privacy — are verified continuously:

- **Contract tests (17)** in `contract/src/test/`:
  - `eligibility.test.ts` — the full eligibility matrix, multi-lender records,
    issuer authentication, and admin governance.
  - `privacy.test.ts` — proves the exact income, default flag, and signature
    material never appear in any serialized public state, and that distinct
    users are keyed by 32-byte identity hashes.
- **Frontend engine tests (7)** in `frontend/src/test/engine.test.ts` — re-run
  the same matrix through the actual compiled contract in a node environment
  (needed because the WASM runtime does not run inside jsdom), plus a privacy
  guarantee on the returned outcome shape.
- **App smoke tests (2)** in `frontend/src/test/App.test.tsx` — the dashboard
  renders all sections and the simulated wallet connects.

```bash
npm run contract:test   # 17 tests
npm run frontend:test   # engine + app smoke tests
```

## CI/CD

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to
`main` and pull request:

1. Installs the pinned Compact devtools + compiler (0.31.1).
2. `npm ci`, then compiles the Compact contract to regenerate the managed
   bindings and zkir artifacts.
3. Runs contract typecheck / test / build.
4. Runs frontend typecheck / build / test.

This mirrors the validated local toolchain so every change is verified against
real compiled contract artifacts.

## Demo

Run the local, in-browser demo of the official compiled contract:

```bash
npm run frontend:dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

The dashboard guides you through **connect wallet → financial credential →
lender requirement → outcome**, computing genuine eligibility results from the
real compiled circuit (the exact income stays witness-only). A **demo video** is
planned; see [Roadmap](#roadmap--deferred) and `LEVEL4_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Preprod deployment & contract address

On-chain deployment on Midnight **Preprod** is documented in
[docs/deploy-onchain.md](./docs/deploy-onchain.md) but is **not yet executed** —
it requires a running proof server (`midnight_bn254`, needs Docker) and a funded
Preprod wallet, then wiring the provider stack needed by `midnight-js-contracts`
4.x.

Per the project's honesty rules the contract address is **never fabricated**:

- `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `contract/src/config.ts` and `frontend/src/config.ts`
  retains the placeholder `TODO_PASTE_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_AFTER_DEPLOY`.
- `docs/contract-address.txt` records the truthful "not deployed yet" status.
- `npm run deploy` runs a readiness preflight and reports the true environment
  state instead of emitting a fake address.

Once a real deployment exists, the genuine address is pasted into those configs
and recorded in `docs/contract-address.txt`.

## X (Twitter) profile

A project X profile is planned but **not yet created** — the handle/social URL
is intentionally left blank here so no fabricated link is recorded. Track this
under **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED** in `LEVEL4_CHECKLIST.md`.

---

## Honesty note

This repository does **not** fabricate deployment results. Until a genuine
Preprod deployment exists, `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is a typed placeholder and the
deploy CLI reports the true readiness state rather than emitting a fake address.
All results shown by the demo are computed by the **real compiled contract**, not
mocked.
